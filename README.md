Operating Systems
=================

The assignments from operating systems course, spring 2012. I've attempted to 
explain some things from what I can remember of them but I probably left out 
a lot of things considering it's now the end of the fall 2012 semester.

There's a lot of loose files lying around. Some of them are old versions from 
before I really used version control (e.g., `blah_old.c`), some are test files 
for the particular assignment.
