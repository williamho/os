Write a FIFO!

#My description, a full semester later
Learned about synchronization (mutexes, semaphores, ways to avoid deadlock, etc). 
Used that knowledge to create a FIFO. Multiple writers and one reader. The 
writers should block until there is open space in the FIFO.

We were provided with some handwritten assembly code that implemented 
the TAS (test and set) function.
