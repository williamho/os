Write a scheduler!

#My description, a full semester later
There was no assignment 9. Assignment 10 was to write a scheduler, something 
like what the Linux kernel uses: with static and dynamic priority, context 
switching, implementing your own `fork()` and having to manage the stack space 
of mini-programs (functions) inside your own program and switching between them 
whenever time ran out. Essentially simulating a multi-threaded program (or 
a multiple single-threaded processes).

Different process states such as running, ready, zombie, sleeping, etc. 

I used a token bucket system. I remember this assignment being really 
complicated, and I don't think I can really explain it well right now.
